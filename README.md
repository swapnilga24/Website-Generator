Website Generator

The idea behind the project is that customer who wants to generate a website for his business and he did not
know technology can also create his website and maintain it. so we create one website which contains the
name of a business with some templates. so a user can choose any template and proceed. so based on the
template we generate one form and the user has to fill the form. we store this information into the database.
and generate one website with that information. and finally, we give the link of the website to the user. and
also we created someyoutube videos in which we are shown the steps to get the free domain name and a free
SSL certificate for the website.
